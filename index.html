                <p>
                    Knights swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those 
                    who cannot defend themselves; to protect all women and children; 
                    to obey their captains, their liege lord, and their king; to 
                    fight bravely when needed; and do such other tasks as are laid 
                    upon them, however hard or humble or dangerous they may be. They 
                    are expected to be brave and just, and to defend the innocent and 
                    the weak.

                        <p>
                            Jousting is a martial game between two horseriders wielding lances with 
                            blunted tips. The primary aim is to replicate a clash of heavy cavalry, 
                            with each participant trying hard to strike the opponent while riding 
                            towards him at high speed, breaking the lance on the opponent's shield 
                            or jousting armour if possible, or unhorsing him.
